*Old image*

It was June of 2014 when this happened. Streets/Highways were just not apt for this mean thing. Started doing trackdays and the love deepened. 2017, decided to convert this into a race bike only.

As of May 2017, this is how it looks:

#### The conversion

Aftermarket stuff and ~removed mods~:

| Part | Slurp |
| ----- | ----- |
| ~~Tail eliminator~~ | Clean tail |
| ~Driven racing grips~ | Stocks were supposed to be thrown I guess |
| ~Tail lamp with integrated turn sigs~ | Because looks cool |
| SC-project CRT exhaust | Big pipe |
| Pirelli Diablo Rosso Corsas | Much better handling in corners |
| CRG brake and clutch levers | Well to match the red |
| Zero Gravity Corsa race windscreen | I am too tall |
| GB racing casing for engine | Gotta save it |
| Bauce racing ECU remap | No more street riding, smoother power delivery |
| DID racing 520 chain | 520 is the way to go |
| Driven racing front -1 sprocket | More power at lower rpms |
| Driven racing rear +1 sprocket | Coming off corners |
| Armourbodies race fairings | Easy to take on and off, fibreglass |
| Catalytic converter removed | Noise/Sound/Music Straight pipe |
| K&N air filters | Breathe healthy |
| Tech3 Yamaha livery | Why not? |
