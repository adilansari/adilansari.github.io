*Old image*

It was June of 2014 when this happened. Streets/Highways were just not apt for this mean thing. Started doing trackdays and the love intensified. 2017, decided to convert this into a race track only bike.

As of July 2017, this is how it looks:

#### The conversion

Aftermarket stuff and ~removed mods~:

| Part | Slurp |
| ----- | ----- |
| ~~Tail eliminator~~ | Clean tail |
| Driven racing grips | Stocks were supposed to be thrown I guess |
| ~~Tail lamp with integrated turn sigs~~ | Because LED and clean |
| SC-project CRT exhaust | Free flowing open pipe |
| Pirelli Diablo Rosso Corsas | For handling them low corners |
| CRG brake and clutch levers | CNC clicker levers |
| Zero Gravity Corsa race windscreen | Aerodynamics |
| GB racing casing for engine | Gotta protect it |
| Bauce racing ECU remap | Removing factory restrictions, set up for track |
| DID racing 520 chain | Lighter, less friction |
| Driven racing front -1 sprocket | More power at lower rpms |
| Driven racing rear +1 sprocket | For the pull coming off corners |
| Armourbodies race fairings | Easy to take on and off, fibreglass |
| Catalytic converter removed | No more emission sensors, unrestricted exchaust flow |
| K&N air filters | Breathe healthy |
| Moto D racing clip ons | Adjustable handlebars |
| GPR V4 steering dampner | Stabilized steering, less tank slapping |
| Motion Pro throttle asembly | Much more aggressive throttle response |
| Ohlins fork springs | Stiffer forks dialed in for my weight |
| Eibach racing rear shock | Lighter rear suspension spring for stability |
| Tech3 Yamaha livery | Why not? |
