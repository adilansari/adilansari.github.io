## Travel
- Took off on Friday night to Chicago from SF, overnight flight landed at 4.30 in morning.
- Picked a rental car to Indianapolis Motor Speedway, still 200 miles to destination.
- Took a nap in a rest area after a sleepless night.
- Indianapolis was such a deserted town compared to SF.

## Qualifying, Saturday
- Went directly to paddocks and roamed around a bit.
- Backyard to pits and team garages, this was exciting.
- You cannot actually see teams working inside garages but they occassionally come out for parts.
- Within first 5 minutes, [Andrea Doviozoso](https://twitter.com/AndreaDovizioso) raced past me on his scooter.

- Went to Moto America and Moto2 team garages, huge trucks around there.
- Graves motorsport had the healthiest lineup.
- Stunt shows on other part of the raceway.

- Waited for [Valentino](https://twitter.com/ValeYellow46) outside the garage for like an hour and he arrived.
- I just stayed to get a picture, and saw he was giving autographs for fans, I put my hat forward and this happened.
- Jumped around for a bit and left for my hotel.

## Raceday
- Had a sound sleep. Woke up already late for some action.
- Headed directly to the pits. Raining.
- Found an umbrella
- Had a chance to meet [Aleix Espargaro](https://twitter.com/AleixEspargaro), no one knew him so I just reached out.
- Off to stands for race, and penthouse seats didn't disappoint me.

<!-- inset pano  -->

- Rossi managed a hard fought 3rd, but disappointed for Lorenzo.
- Raced to the pits again post celebration.
- Bradley Smith and Aleix Espargaro were the first ones to come out and raced to the offices.
- Not many people knew other racers except VR\|46. Another reason why his garage was swamped with fans and other riders left unnoticed.
- Photobombing Daniel Petrucci and Yossi Hernandez.
- There goes Dani Pedrosa, such a short guy.
- In fact, all these riders were short and lightweight, totally made sense as it helps easy maneuverability and shift of bike weight.
- Andrea Doviozoso, the Ducati rider was having a banter with reporters when I approached him.
- There comes the today's champion Marc Marquez, undefeated for Indianapolis five times in a row.
- A dozen fans surrounded him but not bad, worth waiting 2 hours.
- Most of the teams packed up their stuff, this was the winning bike from today going home.
- Saw Dani Pedrosa leaving in his rental cruze.

- Drove back to Chicago but the freeway was closed so had to detour for 70 miles through farmlands.
