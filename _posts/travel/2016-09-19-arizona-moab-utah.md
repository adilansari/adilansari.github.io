A normal weekend trip that was supposed to head Westwards towards California from Phoneix, AZ ended in Utah, :grin:. But as they say, best moments happen when they are unplanned. Another one of those 1000+ miles weekend trip. Left Saturday morning from Phoenix and did an all night 550 mile drive back to catch a 4 AM flight to California and get to work on time.

###### Monument Valley
Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, a red-sand desert region on the Arizona-Utah border, is a frequent filming location for Western movies. Its an outdoor park that can be explored by looping a 17-mile Valley Drive. Best part is - you can go off roading in your own vehicle :sunglasses: .
