I am a half engineered Indian and an online nobody based in beautiful San Francisco. Here you'll find code snippets, travel pictures, rants and other stuff. 

* Assisted [Ajastra](http://www.ajastra.com), a digital marketing startup, in its early stage and [Minority Workflow](http://www.minorityapp.com), another pre-seed startup based in Russia.
* Soccer is another half side of my life, busted my knee twice. A die hard [Gunner](http://www.arsenal.com).
* Fancy setting up a soccer training academy for kids in India.
* Recently got my [US Soccer national coaching license F](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/379/19656719394_14037ed169_b.jpg). Will have to see how far I go with it.
* Autos. Had a rear wheel driven [C230](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8823/17886112075_b2f611776a_h.jpg), now just a [Yamaha R6](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/688/21142235836_74c6c76397_h.jpg).
* Occassional weekend moto racer.
* Learning how to use a [camera](https://www.500px.com/adilansari).
* Inspired by business mavericks who think big, who think out of the box, and who donâ€™t stop fighting for it until they get it.
