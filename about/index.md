I am a half engineered Indian and an online entrepreneur based in beautiful San Francisco.

* Assisted [Ajastra](http://www.ajastra.com), a digital marketing startup, in its early stage.
* Nurturing my entrepreneurial spirit as I move forward with [Minority Workflow](http://www.minorityapp.com), another pre-seed startup based in Russia.
* Soccer is another half side of my life, busted my knee twice and now waiting for a total knee reconstruction. A die hard [Gunner](http://www.arsenal.com).
* Fancy setting up a soccer training academy for kids in India.
* Recently got my [US Soccer national coaching license F](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/379/19656719394_14037ed169_b.jpg). Will have to see how far I go with it.
* Autos. Currently, a rear wheel driven [C230](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8823/17886112075_b2f611776a_h.jpg) and [Yamaha R6](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/688/21142235836_74c6c76397_h.jpg).
* Occassional weekend moto racer.
* Attracted to the beauty and prowess of chronograph watches.
* Inspired by business mavericks who think big, who think out of the box, and who donâ€™t stop fighting for it until they get it.
